                <h1>Main Focus</h1>
                <p>The main focus of my four months at BlackBerry was developing and maintaining applications that would be used for internal testing of radio functionality. Using skills in C/C++/Qt, I built and maintained applications designed to run on a BlackBerry 10 device. A general example of an application to test radio functionality would be an interface that allowed you to insert information about a local or remote file, provide an IP address to connect to as a client or host, and then execute a file transfer between the two connections via cellular.</p>
                
               <p> I had three main projects pertaining to this focus that I will outline in as much detail as possible while using discretion considering the confidential nature of the Research and Development department at BlackBerry.</p>
                
                <p><li>Project 1: Update the FTP client application</li><image src="images/ftp.png" style="float:right"></image></p>
                
                <p>For this task I was to update the process by which information was passed from the code to the UI and vice versa. The old implementation was very complex and hard to navigate. By creating a new class for storing and passing to the UI, I was able to cut out code and structure the application in a sensible and easy to read manner. This allowed for processes such as saving data in stored profiles much more simple. This project was a great starting project that challenged me, and helped build my confidence with the development process on a BlackBerry.</p>
                
               <p> <li>Project 2: Include support for IPv6</li></p>
                
                <p>My second major application development project was to implement changes in some of the older apps to support the more modern IPv6 addressing. In the legacy implementation an IPv6 address would break the parsing and the app would not function as expected. For this project, I had to ensure that an IPv6 address could be read and all identifications of the connection were properly in place to set up a socket. This was a challenging project, but definitely taught me a lot by forcing me to seek help outside my direct automation team.</p>
                
                <p><li>Project 3: Data Connections application</li></p>
                
                <p>This project was my final task for my term. My goal was to build a whole new app of my own instead of simply improving or maintaining a pre-existing one. I was very excited to start this, as it would be from scratch and push my abilities. The application needed to manage and display information about the data connections on the device. Due to the confidential nature of this work I am unable to describe the technical details pertaining to this app, but I can say that I appreciated the responsibility that my manager instilled in me to implement this app to contribute to the testing that takes place on our team. I am very happy to have worked on it, and to know that it will continue to grow and be maintained by future co-ops and full timers. Due to time restrictions of my term at BlackBerry, I was unable to finish all features of the app in my preferred structure, but it is at a stable and functional state ready to be worked on by future students.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, I loved being part of the application development side of BlackBerry. It was exactly the type of programming I love. I was able to make changes and see my work directly affect a product. This aspect was very satisfying and gave me a sense of accomplishment. I would recommend this position to anyone with similar interests!</p>
