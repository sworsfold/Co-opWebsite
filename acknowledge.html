                <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
                <p>I would like to make a few acknowledgments to recognize those who helped me during my co op work terms.</p>
                
                <p>BlackBerry</p>
                
                <p>Firstly my manager at BlackBerry, Imad Azzam. Imad was a fantastic manager who offered me such strong support throughout all my terms at BlackBerry. He was open to ideas and very thorough in his explanations. Having this type of personality around was so motivating.
                
                Another thank you is to my full-time coworker during my first two terms, Wen Zhou. Wen helped to train me upon arrival and showed me all the ropes. He provided me with practice problems and helped me to settle in as fast as I could.</p>
                
                <p>PerkinElmer</>
                
                <p>Mark Roy was my supervisor during my time at PerkinElmer. He is a great manager and was always willing to help wherever possible. Mark was aware of my passion for automated web testing and really helped to involve me in tasks that were typical of a 'developer in test' role. I am so grateful that he took his time to make sure I was happy with my tasks. I also appreciate the fact that Mark was willing to get to know me as a person and not just a co-op student. I definitely hope to remain in contact with him beyond my work term.
                
                Rose Gallo is the HR generalist at the PerkinElmer Guelph site. I want to thank her for all her support during my work term. She was very approachable and always put a big smile on my face.
                
                I would also like to thank my scrum team as a whole which consisted of Harold Miller-Koren (scrum master), Terry Lyons, Heesung Ahn, Anupama Sirohi, as well as Mark. I would also like to acknowledge the fact that Harry and Chad Millen, the site's Software Development Manager, were very supportive of my automation efforts.
                
                If I could list everyone that I worked alongside at PerkinElmer I would. There were so many people in the office that helped to make my work term fantastic.</p>
                
                <p>University of Guelph</p>
                
                <p>From the school side of my co op experience I have Laura Gatto, Cheryl Hulme, and Greg Klotz to thank for being so understanding and supportive during such an important transitional time and always being glad to help.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you everyone :)</p>
