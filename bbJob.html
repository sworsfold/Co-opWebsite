                <h1>Job Description</h1>
                <p>My job as a test application developer essentially consisted of two main components. The first component being to test, maintain, and create applications for the BlackBerry devices used for internal testing. The second component was to maintain and improve on our pre-existing test framework that is in charge of controlling automated testing.
                
                My main focus was maintaining and creating the test applications. I will provide more detail about this in the next page.
                
                My main contributions to the framework this term were re-designing and implementing how a device under test is prepared for automation, and porting all the pre-existing functionalities over to allow support for a windows OS higher than XP.
                
                I was also happy to learn that my project manager had more VBA work for me this term. I was able to write out many scripts one of which was a large script that helped to merge all the data for test suites when a new version became released. This was my largest VBA assignment yet, and by far the most fun!
                
                I had such a positive experience at BlackBerry the first time around that I chose to reapply under the same manager, but try a new position.</p>
