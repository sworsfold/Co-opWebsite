                <h1>Job Description</h1>
                <p><image src="images/rim.jpg" style="float:right; padding:2px 10px;"></image>My job as a wireless protocol specialist consisted of a number of responsibilities. To sum up all my work, my role included automating, running, and debugging cellular radio test cases required for accepting devices on simulated and live networks. I also had a large responsibility of adding and testing new features to the test automation framework.</p>
                
                <p>My main project during my work term was to automate test cases required by AT&T for accepting devices and those that target cellular functionality described in Release 7 3GPP specifications. This project will be described in greater detail in the main term focus page.</p>
                
                <p>Another responsibility I had was to analyze results from weekly testing. This required me to evaluate the outcome of numerous tests and categorize the failures into problems with the device, framework, or the network (whether live or simulated via the Anite SAS network simulator) used to run the tests. To debug these failures I would analyze logs and perform specific rerun tests. This allowed me to simulate the situation the test was in upon failure, and understand the problem to take necessary action.</p>
                
                <p>In terms of adding features to the framework I had two major contributions and numerous smaller functions. My major contributions consisted of loading required files onto the device automatically and allowing for an event based radio functionality lookup for reference during test case execution.</p>
                
                <p>I also was called upon for small side projects by our teams project manager. I became his go to person for small helpful VBA scripts for organizing important team data in excel.</p>
                
                <p>I chose this employer as I knew it was such an innovative and exciting company in the field, and I wanted to explore the telecommunications industry.</p>
