                <h1>Main Focus</h1>
                <p><image src="images/selenium.png" style="float:left; padding:2px 10px;"></image>During my time at PerkinElmer, my main focus was to facilitate moving forward with automated testing. Automated testing helps to ensure quality products more efficiently and accurately. My focus was to build up a framework in C# using the Selenium 2.0 API. This required analyzing HTML elements of the web application, building up framework methods to interact with these elements, and finally building out test cases that call certain methods to satisfy specific testing workflows. A significant amount my time was put into starting up the automation framework for two of the iLAB modules. After the smoke tests were implemented for each module, I worked on stabilizing the tests and adding framework functionality such as screenshot capabilities. Near the end of my term I was in charge of creating training exercises for new testers and helping to train the new co-op student.<image src="images/fwa.jpg" style="float:right; padding:2px 10px;"></image></p>
                
                <p>Due to my interest in automation, I was able to partake in two different assessments for third-party browser/platform testing services. I worked on integrating our framework and tests with these services and reported on my findings with each service. The goal of using these services would be to test web applications against a numbIMG_3950er of OS and browser combinations. This allows the product to be supported in majority of customer environments.</p>
                
                <p>During my last week at PerkinElmer I was awarded with the Fine Work Award for my efforts in automation, testing services investigations, and Jenkins integration.</p>
