                <h1>Skills and Application</h1>
                <p>These positions at BlackBerry definitely required me to possess communication skills, organization, an analytical mind, and dedication. I had developed a strong base for these skills through school, but saw improvement in all areas on the job. Skills that I saw strongly improve on the job were my analytical view and my programming in general. I had some programming background from school, but working in a real-life scenario I was able to directly apply this knowledge and expand my skills in a practical and hands-on manner.</p>
                
                <p>I would say the most interesting and unique aspect of my job was working with the new BlackBerry 10 operating system. I feel very privileged to be a part of such an opportunity and to have helped in the progress toward release.</p>
                
                <p>Two aspects of my first position really stuck out to me, I really loved working in a close knit team and having weekly discussions of our progress and results during my first term. This made it possible for us to develop a sense of communication which facilitated collaboration and productivity. The second aspect was the opportunity to train new co-op students, this helped me to solidify everything I had learnt and spend time teaching others.</p>
                
                <p>Two aspects of my second term that have stayed with me is the independent nature of my job, and the unique work. I appreciated the sense of independence and responsibility that my manager instilled in me with my tasks. He allowed me to approach a problem at my own angle, and if I needed help would provide me with gentle suggestions for alternatives. This allowed me to analyze how I approach a task and where I need improvement!</p>
                
                <p>These positions have enhanced my academic experience in the sense that I was able to work in parallel with my coworkers on the same project. Although a lot of my tasks were individual the overall framework in total was a large group effort. This taught me how to put my academic skills to practice in a group and learn how to collaborate work.</p>
