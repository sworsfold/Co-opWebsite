                <h1>Goals</h1>
                
                <p><image src="images/goals2.jpg" style="float:left; padding:2px 10px;"></image>The goals that I started my work term with were very broad and general such as managing tasks, which was chosen as it is a matter of self motivation and allowed me to manage my time and prioritize my tasks. Another goal I had was management of problem solving by myself. I chose this goal as it would force me to be analytical and allow me to use my problem solving abilities. My third goal was in communication. I wanted to communicate with my coworkers in a professional manner, but still remain involved in the BlackBerry community outside of the workplace. I chose this goal to further my skills in communicating with others in the industry and expand my network of connections.</p>
                
                <p>I was able to attain my original goals by keeping an organized spreadsheet of tasks, forming a booklet of comprehensive notes, and attending BlackBerry social events.</p>
                
                <p>After working in my position for a few weeks I noticed that my immediate goals started relating more to particular tasks I was working on, such as finishing a certain number of cases by a specific date or adding a certain amount of functionality to the framework in one week.</p>
                
                <p>Upon completion of my term I feel that I was successful in attaining my goals and forming a solid position in the team in terms of productivity and communication.</p>
                
                <p><li>Goals specifically targeted at skills</li></p>
                
                <p>I picked up and developed many skills during my 8 months at BlackBerry but coming into the job the skills I hoped to work on and improve the most were communication, as discussed above, and my programming skills. I was successful in improving both of these skills, but also many more emerged as my work term progress as specifically mentioned in the skills and application page.</p>
                
                <p><li>Goals specifically targeted at technologies</li></p>
                
                <p>Upon applying for a job at BlackBerry I most hoped to be working on the new BlackBerry10 operating system and be a part of that new adventure at BlackBerry. My technology specific goal was to be able to contribute to this new product. I am so proud to say I was a part of the progress towards release, and this opportunity was truly a privilege.</p>
