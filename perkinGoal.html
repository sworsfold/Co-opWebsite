                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>I had many goals for this work term, but the goals listed below were the most important to me.</p>
                
               <p> <li>Goals specifically targeted at skills</li></p>
                
               <p> Upon applying to a QA position, I did not expect to be developing upon my programming skills. This is often a goal that I hold as high priority for my work terms. However, by becoming involved in automated testing, I was able to work on my programming skills and become competent using C#, which was unfamiliar to me prior to the work term. As usual, there is always room for improvement in this area!</p>
                
                <p>Another skill that I always aim to improve during a work term is my communication. I was able to work on this goal as our team participated in daily stand up meetings that required updates from each team member.</p>
                
                <p>My last goal was to be an effective team member and make an effort to integrate myself into the team. I hoped to feel very comfortable with the team, and bring knowledge and hard work to our group. This goal was easily achieved, as everyone on my team was very supportive and approachable. Upon completion of my time at PerkinElmer, I feel very comfortable with my co-workers and feel as though I have provided knowledge and effort towards our project.</p>
                
                <p><li>Goals targeted at technology</li></p>
                
                <p>My first goal targeted at technology was to aid in the building of a comprehensive and usable Selenium test framework, which can be built upon and maintained with little effort. My co-workers assisted me in reaching this goal, as they gave me the opportunity to take charge of two modules to automate alone. This motivated me to participate in thorough training for building a framework, and complete in depth code reviews.<p>
                
                <p>My second goal targeted at technology was to feel comfortable with using a Browser/OS combination service with our Selenium framework, and helping to complete the integration of the automated tests with Jenkins. I spent a significant amount of time integrating the different trial services and running our tests using the third party hub. This effort ensured I was comfortable using the services with the Selenium framework. I was also a key player the process of integrating the Automated UI tests with Jenkins, a continuous integration service. This was a great learning experience, as I had no prior experience with Jenkins. Not many other people in the office had experience either, so being heavily involved with this setup was very exciting and challenging.</p>
