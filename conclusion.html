                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>To conclude this cooperative education report I want to say that it is such a fantastic opportunity and I would recommend the program to anyone who can take it, and I say this with utmost confidence! All of my work terms have met my expectations in the sense I was able to work individually and branch out, but still have such a supportive backing behind me for guidance. My terms also provided me with solid experience and helped me to expand my knowledge in the field. I chose to apply for co op as I wanted to enrich my studies with industry experience throughout my degree, and each position has proven to me that it was the right choice.</p>
                
                <p>I am so privileged to have worked at BlackBerry and PerkinElmer and I would definitely go back to both employers. This co op experience offered me so much and helped me to broaden my view of the industry and my own potential.</p>
                
                <p>To review what I feel is in important I would like to address some main points or tips!
                
                Working in an office job that was outside of my comfort zone allowed me to learn a few things about my future that I would like students to take from this report. My advice is to never steer yourself away from a project or position because you feel intimidated by it. You have much more potential than you are aware of and with small pushes you will surprise yourself and get so much more out of your work. Lastly, know that you have an incredible support system through school, home, and your workplace. Use this to your advantage to ask questions and give 100%.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for reading through my website, I hope it has allowed you to gain some insight on my experience during my Co op terms and the cooperative education experience in general.</p>
