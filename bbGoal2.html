                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p><image src="images/goals.png" style="float:right; padding:2px 10px;"></image>Having already experienced a work term, I decided to start this term with goals that went a bit deeper than my general goals of last term.</p>
                
                <p>My first goal was to attempt to tackle most problems without the help of my manager where possible. I built on this goal from last term, as I was in a much more independent position that forced me to measure my success in this area. This goal forced me to analyze a problem from multiple perspectives with a critical mind. My plan to achieve this goal was to take extremely detailed notes on any concepts that could be of future use, practice research skills on team webpages and the internet in general, and to learn from other co-op students and full timers. In order to measure my success with this goal, I hoped to feel comfortable with our framework modules, be able to create concise documentation upon finishing my work term, and complete all assignments with little or no immediate help from my manager. Upon reaching the end of my term I can reflect on this goal and say that I meant my expectations and greatly improved my independent work habits.</p>
                
                <p>My second goal was to become more communicative with my peers. By attempting to
                complete my first goal in positions, I often find myself forgetting to communicate orally with those around me and learn from them. I chose this goal as it would force me to open up and build interpersonal skills. My plan to measure my success of this goal was by ensuring I have attended at least two BlackBerry social events, approached a number of co-ops/full timers seeking advice or help, and finally I hope to leave my term knowing majority of my team members. Upon completion of my term I would say I still need improvement in this area, as I am constantly focused on work. I only attended one BlackBerry social event, but I definitely opened up and built a solid foundation of networks with my full time counterparts that I felt comfortable approaching for help. I can safely say I am leaving this term knowing many more people than before, and I feel much more comfortable around the full timers on my team!</p>
                
                <p><li>Goals specifically targeted at skills</li></p>
                
                <p>I picked up and developed many skills during my second position at BlackBerry, but coming into the job the skill I hoped to work on and improve the most was my programming skills. I was successful in improving my programming ability and became capable in a new language, but there is always room for improvement in this area!</p>
                
                <p><li>Goals specifically targeted at technologies</li></p>
                
               <p> Upon applying for my first job at BlackBerry, I most hoped to be working on the new BlackBerry10 operating system and be a part of that new adventure at BlackBerry. My technology specific goal was to be able to contribute to this new product. For this term, my goal was to become much more comfortable with the OS, and successfully build my own test application.</p>
