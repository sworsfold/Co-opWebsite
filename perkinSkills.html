                <h1>Skills and Application</h1>
                <p>My time at PerkinElmer required a strong set of skills in communication, analysis, and organization. These skills are consistently improving over my work terms and my academic semesters. A skill that I saw improve over my work term at PerkinElmer was my analytical view. The construction of the automation framework required a significant amount of analysis and this forced me to look at the development task through the eyes of a tester.</p>
                
                <p>An interesting and unique aspect of my job was investigating and reporting on the two different browser/platform services on behalf of our team. I feel privileged to have had this responsibility instilled in me, and I enjoyed playing around with the options of both services. This task allowed me to further develop my analytical skills and my written communication.</p>
                
                <p>For this work term the independence within a team was an aspect that struck me. I appreciated the sense of independence and responsibility that my manager instilled in me with my automation tasks. He allowed me to approach a problem at my own angle, and if I needed help he would always be available to talk through a problem. This allowed me to analyze how I tackle problems, and more specifically what methods help me to get through issues such as explaining to others or drawing out diagrams. The independence was a great aspect of the job, but the fact that I had a tight-knit team that I was working alongside made me so much more confident in my role.</p>
                
                <p>The independent nature of my role also allowed me to improve on my technical research skills. A notable example of this is my work on the integration of the automated test cases with Jenkins. My supervisor was out of the country for work, but I was determined to finish the job before the end of my term. This independent nature of my role forced me to answer my own questions through thorough research in order to complete the task.</p>
                
                <p>My time at PerkinElmer has enhanced my academic experience, as I was working in an agile development environment. I have been educated on agile practices through academic lectures, but prior to my work term these methods had always been very intangible. The opportunity to work in this environment helped me to solidify any relevant knowledge I have gained from University.</p>
