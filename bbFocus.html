                <p>The main focus of my 8 months at BlackBerry was automating Release 7 3GPP test cases and those required by AT&T for accepting devices. AT&T is a multinational large scale provider in he telecommunications industry and 3GPP, or 3rd Generation Partnership Project, sets the mobile broadband standard by describing specific cellular radio functionality in released technical specs. BlackBerryâ€™s testing plans were made up according to the guidelines set out by cellular functionality described in 3GPP specs. Automating required me to analyze these test plans and ensure that the corresponding test case was considered automated within our framework. The test plans for AT&T are sent to all companies providing a passing requirement for the devices to be accepted. The reason this was such a main focus was not only due to the number of test cases, but also due to the intricacy of the specifications and plans. It was my responsibility to ensure that our testing framework could handle all situations required of the specifications set out by each of these test cases as they were executed. This main project required me to explore wireless protocol processes, add coded functionality to a large modular framework, and run large scale testing campaigns on certain devices and SIM cards.</p>

                <p>The process involved analyzing the test plan and scrutinizing all applicable 3GPP test specifications for any clarification. To have cases run automatically certain functionality needed to be accessible in the framework to ensure the device was in the required state. Test cases have steps that need to be interpreted into device actions, and I worked and enhanced a system that performs this interpretation. This gave way to another aspect of my job which was contributing to and maintaining our test framework. If the test were to run into any problems upon execution, I would try to debug the problem as discussed in my job description page and likely revisit specs.</p>
                
                <p>Due to my working on strictly confidential prerelease products I cannot give many details on results and specific cases, but my main focus of my work term in general terms was contributing to the total number of cases that we could test automatically via simulators over the weekend and during week nights.</p>
